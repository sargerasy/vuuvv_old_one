Joyou Group (&quot;Joyou&quot;) intends to set up a new plant for ceramic sanitary ware products, such as basins, toilets, and similar ceramic products. The investment for the project amounts to approximately RMB 350 million (EUR 38.8 million) for the production facilities and a further RMB 70 million (EUR 7.8 million) for working capital which will be funded from operations. Parts of Joyou AG''s proceeds from its IPO in March 2010 will be used to finance the project. The project has been approved by the supervisory board and commencement of operations is expected for the second quarter of 2011.<br />\r<br />\rAs the Chinese economy continues its high growth and rapid urbanization path, demand for ceramic sanitary ware products continues to increase. In part this increase is also due to the strong adoption of Western urban living styles and increased income per capita. Joyou currently sells ceramic sanitary ware products under the Joyou brand, however, production of such products is at present outsourced to third-party manufacturers.<br />\r<br />\rBy bringing in-house this ceramics manufacturing capability, Joyou believes it will gain better quality and cost control, and hence be able to provide improved service to customers. Moreover, this will also significantly increase Joyou&rsquo;s gross margins compared to the current outsourcing strategy. A further goal is to increase Joyou''s success in selling to the project business segment, such as new residential, office, or hotel developments, where purchases are normally made directly from the manufacturer.<br />\r<br />\rThe new production site, which will include two new factory workshops, will be located in Meiyu Industrial Park, Luncang Town, Nan&rsquo;an City, Fujian Province, in the PRC, on a land plot of approximately 140,000 sqm. In the first phase after commencement of operations, the production capacity of the plant is expected to reach about 1.8 million - 2 million units per year.<br />\r<br />\rDuring the preparations for its IPO, Joyou still envisaged the acquisition of an existing ceramic sanitary ware company.

I would like to start off by asking, Why are Joyou and Grohe starting this strategic initiative?</p>\r<p>&nbsp;</p>\r<p>[Gverry Mulvin]: There are three main reasons: First, Grohe has a strong International sales network, which will, no doubt, assist Joyou in opening up global markets. Second, Joyou has an extensive sales network in China which compliments Grohe''s current sales network in China. We believe that one plus one is greater than two and it will enable Grohe to develop faster in China. Third, we hope that the cooperation with Joyou will not only make our global image and brand better, but also add some elements of Chinese culture into our brand and image so as to be closer to Chinese consumers.</p>\r<p>&nbsp;</p>\r<p>[Hu Yanli]: Could you explain some of the specifics of your cooperation with Joyou?</p>\r<p>&nbsp;</p>\r<p>[Gverry Mulvin]: I can give you the following example: Grohe has good penetration in markets all around the world, but our products sold in GMS, for example, in East European countries, are only high-end. We currently lack mid-range to high-end products. The cooperation with Joyou is a good fit because they can fill in the blanks of mid-range consumer products. Judging from our current sales network, we think that we can grow rapidly in China and fill in the blanks in many second, third and fourth-tier cities through cooperation with Joyou. Currently, Grohe&rsquo;s products in China are aimed at the high-end market. We have 115 stores and we hope that Grohe, with Joyou AG''s cooperation, will establish 500 to 600 stores in the next 6 to 12 months. With these new locations we will be able to serve consumers better and bring German technology, design and quality to more points of sale in China.</p>\r<p>&nbsp;</p>\r<p>[Hu Yanli]: You have mentioned your expectations with regards to cooperation with Joyou in China. I would like to know how China fits into Grohe''s global strategy.</p>\r<p>&nbsp;</p>\r<p>[Gverry Mulvin]: China is one of the three main strategic priorities for the headquarters of Grohe AG; the other two being the USA and Germany where we hope Grohe can continue to be a leader in high-end products. With respect to the importance of the China market, there are at least 40 million people moving from rural areas to cities annually. This is a great opportunity for us to sell more high-quality Grohe brand products. To put this into perspective, 40 million people is equivalent to the total urbanized population of other countries. Grohe AG hopes to capture a big part of that market in China. In conclusion, we can complete our product line and our sales network through this cooperation.</p>\r<p>&nbsp;</p>\r<p>[Hu Yanli]: As the general director in China, what do you think of China&rsquo;s market performance under the uncertain market conditions?</p>\r<p>&nbsp;</p>\r<p>[Chen Yongxing]: Grohe AG has very good performance in China and its performance in the second, third and fourth quarters increased by over 30 percentage points in comparison with those of previous year. Despite the financial crisis, even the first quarter showed some growth. At present, China is becoming a major contributor for Grohe AG, both in sales amount and profit. Therefore, business cooperation in China is becoming more important for Grohe.</p>\r<p>&nbsp;</p>\r<p>[Hu Yanli]: Can you outline the reasons for the 30% growth?</p>\r<p>&nbsp;</p>\r<p>[Chen Yongxing]: We have grown in both retail sales and engineering. Sales of many competitors this year are worse than last year, but we have grown. We hope that we will be able to match fast growth in China as well as in Germany.</p>", "creation_date": "2010-01-11 14:37:00", "thumbnail": "/media/upload/images/articles/2010112514365944293.jpg"}}, {"pk": 21, "model": "main.Article", "fields": {"category": 2, "title": "2010 National Joyou Distributors Conference \u2013 Grand opening", "summary": "Joyou kicked off the 2010 National Joyou Distributors Conference at Quanzhou Olympic Park on January 8, 2010.

For example, the relevant financial systems have been running for two years. Particularly, there was much work to be carried out before and after the group went public. If the ERP system had not been applied, the workers of the Financial Department would have had to be increased by two to three times, and more workload would have been incurred, prior to the successful listing. Likewise, for the present, all departments shall devote full attention to the introduced system and formulate the working procedures at an early stage.&rdquo;</div>\r<!--\r<table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" class=\"tb\">\r    <tr>\r        <td class=\"graybg\"><a href=\"#\">Prev</a> <img src=\"/template/images/arrow05.gif\"  /></td>\r        <td><a href=\"#\"><a href=\"/news/35.htm\">Joyou Group is growing fast in the sanitary market</a></a></td>\r    </tr>\r    <tr>\r        <td class=\"graybg\"><a href=\"#\">Next</a> <img src=\"/template/images/arrow06.gif\"  /></td>\r        <td><a href=\"#\"><a href=\"/news/111.htm\">2010 National Joyou Distributors Conference  \u2013 Grand opening</a></a></td>\r    </tr>\r</table>\r-->", "creation_date": "2010-07-10 15:15:48", "thumbnail": "/media/upload/images/articles/2010112515153838785.jpg"}}, {"pk": 32, "model": "main.Article", "fields": {"category": 2, "title": "Jiangsu Regional 2010 Joyou Marketing Summit", "summary": "With the theme of \"Over the Top with Joyou\", the 2010 Jiangsu Regional Marketing Summit was held at Nanjing Suning Venice Hotel on March 28-29.

Joyou successfully listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange at EUR 14.75 a share with a total IPO financing of EUR 105 million, making Joyou the largest Chinese enterprise on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.</p>\r<p>&nbsp;</p>\r<p><b>Joyou awarded the Golden Tripod Prize for Outstanding Marketing</b></p>\r<p>&nbsp;</p>\r<p>On July 18, Joyou''s COO, Jilin Cai, and China&rsquo;s richest man Qinghou Zong were awarded Golden Tripod Awards for being China&rsquo;s most outstanding marketers in the studios of Shandong TV in a ceremony jointly sponsored by China Marketing Magazine.</p>\r<p>&nbsp;</p>\r<p>In only a few months Joyou has been doubly blessed. Joyou not only made headway into a top capital market and the strongest sanitary ware country in Europe, but also won the Golden Tripod prize which is the highest award for Chinese marketers &ndash; also known as the Oscar of China&rsquo;s marketing industry. These achievements show Joyou&rsquo;s development, both in brand building and financing to take advantage of the world''s largest market.</p>\r<p>&nbsp;</p>\r<p>In 2008 same year, Jilin Cai, Joyou COO, assumed the responsibility to enter the domestic market and establish the Joyou brand, leading the domestic marketing team to set up distribution networks in first-tier and second-tier cities all over the country. In total, 3,000 points-of-sale were opened, including national flagship stores, exclusive shops and shops-in-shops.</p>\r<p>&nbsp;</p>\r<p>Meanwhile, the brand image of Joyou has been rapidly developed. This brand growth has been recognized by important national awards including: Chinese Famous Brand Products, and Famous Trademark of China. Likewise, during the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, Joyou cooperated with volunteers from Beijing colleges and universities to create &quot;Smile of Beijing&rdquo; to service the Olympics. Moreover, at the end of 2009, Jingjing Guo, the Olympic diving champion and highly respected Chinese gold-medal athlete, was invited to be Joyou''s brand ambassador to explain the second phase of the major brand marketing campaign titled &ldquo;Joyou, Water of Life&rdquo;.</p>\r<p>&nbsp;</p>\r<p>Joyou continued its marketing plan by establishing a comprehensive strategic partnership with Grohe of Germany. At the beginning of 2010, Joyou also cooperated with the famous Chinese prime-time program &ldquo;Happy Trip across China&rdquo;. Thousands of Joyou&rsquo;s dealers and tens of thousands of audience members participated in the program recording. Sponsorship of this popular national program laid the foundation for continued rapid growth of Joyou''s domestic marketing in 2010. Receiving the Golden Tripod Marketing Award attests to the rapid positioning of the Joyou brand in the national market, but not without a lot of hard work and marketing prowess. When demands in the international market began to shrink two years ago, many export oriented enterprises adopted domestic sales as the expedient measure in the wait-and-see phase. Jilin Cai did his utmost to lead his team to rapidly establish 3,000 points of sale in China, with company performance doubling after only one year. He overcame the business risks with speed and enabled domestic sales to become an important part of the enterprise, making Joyou a leader in the sanitary ware industry. This rapid growth has been followed by international capital.</p>\r<p>&nbsp;</p>\r<p>With regard to China''s market trends, experts in the industry believe that domestic consumption is developing towards channel marketing and brand-based economy with consumers looking for quality that top brands inherently bring. Following these market trends with sound network channels in the sanitary ware industry, Joyou has positioned itself as the largest manufacturer of sanitary ware products and accessories in Fujian province and one of the largest enterprises for exporting taps and copper valves in Asia. In 2009, Joyou enjoyed a net profit of EUR 22.3 million and revenue of EUR 172.3 million, with the lions share of 80% coming from the domestic market. The enormous development opportunity of China''s sanitary ware market, combined with Joyou''s strong brand recognition, have lead the capital markets to give a vote of confidence by investing in Joyou''s future potential.</p>", "creation_date": "2010-04-27 15:26:58", "thumbnail": "/media/upload/images/articles/2010112515265711427.jpg"}}, {"pk": 34, "model": "main.Article", "fields": {"category": 2, "title": "Successful Municipal Government inspections of Joyou", "summary": "On April 9, the municipal government of Quanzhou came to Joyou for an inspection / visit.

Organized by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the forum is also co-sponsored by China Industry News, Party Building Division of the CPC (Central Party School), and China Enterprises Management Association of Science Technology and Industry. This year&rsquo;s forum theme was &quot;Adapt to Change, Speed up infrastructure, and strengthen China&rsquo;s industry&quot;.</p>\r<p>&nbsp;</p>\r<p>According to the Chairman of this year&rsquo;s China Industry Forum, Mr. Jilin Cai, Joyou''s Chief Operating Officer, fully meets the election criteria of &ldquo;advancing China&rsquo;s modern industrialization, daring to explore, innovation, making great contributions to the development of the national industrial economy and exerting significant social influence&rdquo;. He also highly praised Mr. Jilin Cai, &ldquo;who not only embodies Quanzhou merchants&rsquo; tradition of being adept in taking risks and daring to be a forerunner, but that he also actively pioneers in his own field and strives to make innovations, making Joyou a good example for other brands in China.&rdquo;</p>\r<p>&nbsp;</p>\r<p>As the representative of Fujian&rsquo;s sanitary ware industry, Joyou designs, produces and sells faucets and other sanitary products. Joyou is one of China&rsquo;s largest manufactures of sanitary ware products and accessories as well as one of the largest exporters of faucets and copper valve accessories in Asia. As the new generation leader of Joyou, in addition to the excellent qualities of credibility and combativeness inherited from his father Jianshe Cai, Jilin Cai also brings youthful talents of innovative management and aggressive brand promotion to the enterprise. After taking office, he took a series of bold reform measures, leading Joyou and its staff into a brand-new era.</p>\r<p>&nbsp;</p>\r<p>In 2008, soon after taking office, Jilin Cai comprehensively analyzed the opportunities and challenges of the sanitary industry from a knowledgeable and unique perspective of an industrial leader. He made a forward-thinking decision to bring Joyou''s focus back from Europe to China, taking control of Joyou''s future by starting with building the Joyou brand. He employed brand consultants, established a marketing center, built-up comprehensive product lines, set aggressive marketing policies and participated in various types of large exhibitions. In the same year, the newly established Domestic Marketing Team, led by Jilin Cai, set up around 3000 sales points in all the first-tier and second-tier cities in China, and achieved sales revenue of over 1 billion yuan, setting a record and making him a legend in the sanitary ware industry.</p>\r<p>&nbsp;</p>\r<p>On the heals of his first victory, Jilin Cai carried out the second phase of Joyou&rsquo;s return to China which was dubbed &ldquo;Joyou, Harmony with Water&rdquo;. At the end of 2009 Joyou successfully invited Jingjing Guo to act as the brand ambassador for Joyou. The super star who has won multiple gold medals as a diving champion fits harmoniously with Joyou, jointly presenting the &ldquo; Art of water&rdquo;. At the same time, Joyou adopted a whole-new national marketing campaign which greatly enhanced brand and channel promotion throughout the country. The most important move was to join forces with CCTV, China''s top TV Network. During the 2010 Dealer Meeting, Joyou teamed up with CCTV&rsquo;s top entertainment program Happy Traveling Show across China. Chinese stars such as Song Zuying, Shin Band, Aloys Chen, Yu Quan, David Tao, Kelly Chen, SHE, Karen Mok, Julie Su and Han Hong and Olympic champions including Guo Jingjing, Zhang Xiangxiang, Zhao Ruirui and Lin Dan made appearances on the show while promoting the Joyou brand. Dong Qing, the leading CCTV anchorwoman took time to introduce Joyou during the show. The prime-time show, subtitled &ldquo;Charmed by Joyou,&rdquo; perfectly integrates brand promotion into a public entertainment show, instantly making the Joyou brand a household name that is well-known by consumers.</p>\r<p>&nbsp;</p>\r<p>In order to speed up the fulfillment of the target of becoming the No. 1 sanitary brand in China, Jilin Cai made another clever move. At the end of 2009, Joyou announced a win-win cooperation with Germany-based Grohe, a leading global brand for sanitary products and systems, by establishing a Global Strategic Partnership. This new deal laid the groundwork to set up a Grohe Brand Business Unit within Joyou to jointly exploit the domestic and international markets. The move further enhanced the influence of the Joyou brand, providing advantageous resources and a broad platform for Joyou to fulfill the strategic development goal of brand globalization. Experts in the industry acclaim that Joyou offers an excellent example for Chinese sanitary brands to grow into internationally-known high-end brands.</p>\r<p>&nbsp;</p>\r<p>The stage was set. On March 30, 2010, Joyou was successfully listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, officially tapping into the global capital market, taking the brand global. As the first Chinese sanitary enterprise listed in the Prime Standard of a European country, the Joyou brand started the prelude of its capital upgrade. Since its IPO on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Joyou has been of great interest to investors. According to the report by Frankfurt Allgemeine Zeitung on March 30, 2010, Joyou was successfully listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange at the price of 14.75 euros, up 13.5% over the issue price. A total of 105 million euros were raised in the IPO, making Joyou the largest Chinese enterprise on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.</p>\r<p>&nbsp;</p>\r<p>According to Jilin Cai, the funds raised through IPO will be used to strengthen the enterprise&rsquo;s R&amp;D capability, brand building and promotion, and 1,000 new points of sale in China. Joyou will participate in more international exhibitions and introduce a modern sales management and CRM IT system as well as to strengthen the financial and risk management systems in a bid to have a bigger say in the international sanitary market.</p>\r<p>&nbsp;</p>\r<p>Through the company&rsquo;s listing on the Frankfurt Stock Market, Joyou has further consolidated its leading position in the industry. However, Jilin Cai is optimistic, yet cautious for the future. When receiving the Top Ten Outstanding Youths in China''s Industry award, he noted that China&rsquo;s sanitary industry is flooded with enterprises. He forecast that the industry will become highly centralized and Chinese sanitary enterprises will tend to &ldquo;extend outward&rdquo; more, so they must improve their products&rsquo; environment friendliness, their brand&rsquo;s added value and quality. He concluded saying, &ldquo;it is compulsory for sanitary enterprises to improve R&amp;D and IP protection if they aspire to go global. Joyou will further enhance its design ability and strive be a good example for other sanitary brands.&rdquo;</p>", "creation_date": "2010-04-15 15:33:01", "thumbnail": "/media/upload/images/articles/2010112515325193887.jpg"}}, {"pk": 38, "model": "main.Article", "fields": {"category": 2, "title": "2010 MTI Beauty Pageant \u2013 Joyou Sponsored Fujian Province Final", "summary": "The ancient city of Quanzhou was taken over by some of the regions most beautiful young women.

Mr. Wang began by extending a warm welcome to all the outstanding after-sale service personnel, before presenting an analysis of the competition in the sanitary market. In the era of homogeneous competition, as Mr. Wang pointed out, quality after-sale service is the best promotion for future sales. It is an indispensable method to enhance consumer satisfaction and loyalty and can greatly improve the reputation of the company and the brand image. At the end of his speech, Mr. Wang said that the company would continue to enhance its after-sale service standards and expressed his hope that the after-sale service personnel would also be able to enhance their service quality after the session. </span></p>\r<p style=\"line-height:120%\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:\r11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Arial;mso-hansi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\rcolor:#414141\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r<p style=\"line-height:120%\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:\r11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Arial;color:#414141\">The session lasted two days.

He stated that distributors in Chongqing were continuing to expand in number and scale in 2010, and that the company had scored significant achievements with the support and efforts of all distributors. He went on to analyze the current condition and problems in the Chongqing market and pointed out that as competition nowadays lies in team building, funding, the brand, and innovation, it was necessary for the company to gradually shift its mode of operation from that of a family enterprise and toward more team cooperation. He therefore encouraged distributors to fight against the clock for better locations, to open bigger stores with a more favorable market image, to focus on developing the market and closely following trends, so as to build Joyou into a dominant brand in the Chongqing area. He also stated that the company would establish special teams to inspect distributors across China, and dismiss those distributors who failed to change despite warnings. </span></p>\r<p style=\"line-height:120%\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:\r11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Arial;mso-hansi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\rcolor:#414141\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r<p style=\"line-height:120%\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:\r11.0pt;line-height:120%;font-family:Arial;color:#414141\">Finally, Marketing Director Lin Wenwu analyzed the trend of the sanitary industry and discussed effective marketing strategies with the Chongqing distributors to achieve win-win results. He pointed out that Sichuan and Chongqing were important markets for the company, and Joyou would be giving more support to distributors in these two key markets &ndash; especially to cooperative and resourceful distributors &ndash; to make them bigger and stronger.

He reported that Joyou Sanitation&rsquo;s Hunan Marketing Center had worked closely with Hunan&rsquo;s distributors over the past three years. They have grown up together and struggled together for Joyou in the Hunan market where challenges and opportunities exist side by side. Looking ahead to the latter half of 2010, he introduced the marketing methods and market exploration plan for 2010. He pointed out that in the latter half of 2010, the company would implement its strategies with new methods and measures, carry out the work with innovative ideas and a high degree of energy, and realize the five &ldquo;improves&rdquo;, i.e. to improve team quality, sales performance, network quality, differentiated development of the brand, and the nuclear marketing competitiveness, so as to develop the luxury sanitary product market in Hunan and build Joyou into the No.1 brand in Hunan&rsquo;s sanitary industry. </span></p>\r<p style=\"text-align: center; line-height: 120%;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:11.0pt;\rline-height:120%;font-family:Arial;mso-hansi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\rcolor:#414141;mso-font-kerning:0pt\"> <img src=\"/upload/201121119345694286.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></span></p>\r<p align=\"left\" style=\"text-align:left;line-height:120%;\rmso-pagination:widow-orphan\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:11.0pt;\rline-height:120%;font-family:Arial;color:#414141;mso-font-kerning:0pt\">Marketing Director Lin Wenwu summed up the work of the first 6 months of 2010 and elaborated the marketing and brand promotion plan for the latter half of the year. As luxury sanitary products from the USA and Japan are competing with increasing intensity, and mid-to-high end brands are developing rapidly, Joyou Sanitation should speed up its product R&amp;D and brand promotion while continuing to improve its sales channels and the training of its marketing and distributor teams. In this way, it can build up a highly efficient, effective, and capable marketing team, increase the market share and MOR of Joyou, and achieve a win-win relation with its distributors. </span></p>\r<p align=\"left\" style=\"text-align:left;line-height:120%;\rmso-pagination:widow-orphan\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size: 11pt; line-height: 120%; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(65, 65, 65);\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r<p align=\"left\" style=\"text-align:left;line-height:120%;\rmso-pagination:widow-orphan\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size:11.0pt;\rline-height:120%;font-family:Arial;color:#414141;mso-font-kerning:0pt\">Following the speech, Mr. Yan Zhimin, an award-winning lecturer with rich practical experience, was invited to deliver a lecture on the marketing and management of building material stores with special emphasis on practical solutions to the problems that local distributors often come across in sales, market expansion, and brand promotion.

It is reported that toilets account for 50% to 60% of total household water consumption, while in many cities 2 out of every 10 toilets suffer from leaking, dripping, rimming, and other water-related problems.

Joyou AG&acute;s Management Board and Supervisory Board will assess the situation and publish their advice to the shareholders in due course, and can only issue a formal opinion after the tender offer has been made. <br />\rAs major shareholders, me and my son intend to enter into a long-term partnership agreement with Grohe Holding GmbH. It is currently planned that we will contribute the major part of our shares in Joyou AG into Grohe Asia AG, the share holding vehicle, against an issuance of new shares. Thereby we would be locking together the two key anchor investors, Grohe and the Cai family, into a partnership aimed at creating value for both Grohe and Joyou. <br />\rPersonally I believe that this partnership brings synergetic value to both companies by the potential future cooperative structure, and increased participation of Grohe.<br />\r<br />\r<strong>Will you support this offer and recommend shareholders to sell at this low price?<br />\r</strong>Joyou AG&acute;s Management Board and Supervisory Board will assess the situation and publish their advice to the shareholders in due course. The price of 13.50 EUR is only a very slight premium on the three months volume weighted average price. I am aware that the two most recent analyst reports from Macquarie published in November 2010 and Merill Lynch published in Jan 2011 have price targets for Joyou of EUR 17.50 and EUR 18.00 respectively. Thus, I do not anticipate a high acceptance rate. <br />\rThe offer price was determined by Grohe Holding GmbH and I was not involved in the decision making.<br />\r<br />\r<strong>Will you or any of the Cai family sell any shares?<br />\r</strong>That is not what the intended partnership between me, my son Jilin Cai, and Grohe Holding GmbH is about. This transaction is about jointly creating value for Joyou and Grohe.<br />\rMe and my son Jilin Cai as major shareholders with 36.3% of Joyou AG&acute;s shares will not tender any of our shares under the takeover offer. Further, under the non-binding LOI&nbsp; signed with Grohe, I intend to further lock-up the majority of my shares into a joint venture partnership which will be aimed at growing Joyou AG&acute;s business.<br />\rThus, me and my son Jilin Cai, will directly and indirectly remain major shareholders of Joyou AG, with the same share holdings as we currently hold.<br />\rMy brother Jiansheng Cai, who currently holds approximately 1,0% of Joyou&acute;s shares, is not participating in the intended partnership with Grohe and will remain a free shareholder. I can not speak on his behalf but I do not believe that he wants to exit Joyou quickly.<br />\r<br />\r<strong>What are the benefits of the intended takeover for Joyou?<br />\r</strong>Grohe is the number one brand around the world with a global market share of 8% in the sanitary fitting market, and is present in 130 countries globally. Joyou can benefit from a closer cooperation with Grohe in many ways.</p>\r<p>The first tangible benefit is International sales of Joyou products. It is our aim to use the Grohe international channel and relationship network to market the Joyou products and explore profitable business together.</p>\r<p>We expect that this will also lead to increased cooperative and potential in the China market, both in retail and projects.</p>\r<p>There are also operational efficiencies that can be gained from this partnership, not least of which are channel management, development in retail and projects but also of course marketing and brand building.</p>\r<p>In China the Joyou brand will gain substantial up lift by the ever closer cooperation with Grohe, which will not only be at the distributor and retail level, but also in the projects business. This is highly defendable Unique Selling Proposition. Now professional real estate developer purchasing managers have a single source for both their mid-end and high-end developments through this strong partnership, and a national after sales service network. I believe we are the only company in China that can really offer such a differentiated proposition. And to date we have received very positive feedback about this strong unique selling proposition.</p>\r<p>Also on an international stage, Grohe is the market-leader, enjoys strong brand recognition. This partnership, by its very nature, will gain much media attention, which can only help sell Joyou branded products around the world. This all links back to why we did the IPO in Germany, and also using that as a platform for future global sales reach. After this step, I believe that our brand recognition globally will be much higher.</p>\r<p>We expect to also be further involved in many forms of technology and skill transfer.</p>\r<p>Getting back to more tangible benefits, Grohe currently source a significant amount for their products from China, and we are looking to shift much of this purchasing to Joyou.</p>\r<p>So I think you can see that Joyou is gaining increased commitments from one of its anchor investors, and their long-term focus should continue to create significant shareholder value.</p>\r<p>All in all, the partnership has the potential to support the dynamic growth of Joyou for many years to come. The tie up with Grohe, I believe can only serve as an approval of quality. After all, out of all of our shareholders, I believe that Grohe are the one who understand Joyou and the industry the most, second only to Joyou.<br />\r<br />\r<strong>So who has committed to selling their shares?<br />\r</strong>This question, should really be directed to Grohe. All I can say is that Joyou AG was informed by Grohe that they have &ldquo;already secured irrevocable commitments as well as other undertakings from current Joyou shareholders safeguarding voting rights of at least 30 % in Joyou AG&rdquo;. As of the date of the IPO the pre-IPO series A and Series B investors, which included Grohe amounted to 29.1%, the Cai family 37.3%, and the free float 33.6% of Joyou AG&rsquo;s shareholding.<br />\r<br />\r<strong>What do you expect to happen to Joyou&acute;s free-float and does Grohe intend to delist Joyou?<br />\r</strong>Based on the offer terms I assume that Joyou AG will retain a substantial amount of free float after Grohe Holding GmbH&acute;s takeover offer. Thus, also a delisting of Joyou AG is not something that is planned, certainly not on my side. Also for Grohe Holding GmbH, as far as we know, this is not the case. GROHE intends to become a strategic anchor shareholder of Joyou AG.<br />\r<br />\r<strong>Is Grohe Asia AG an operating entity of Grohe?<br />\r</strong>No, it is just a shareholding vehicle, a newly established fully owned subsidiary of Grohe Holding GmbH.<br />\r<br />\r<strong>Will current Joyou shareholders be issued cash or shares in Grohe Asia?<br />\r</strong>The current shareholders will not be issued shares of Grohe Asia AG. After realisation of the partnership agreement, only me and my family and GROHE will be shareholders of Grohe Asia AG. The vehicle will be a partnership structure, and it&rsquo;s shares will not be publicly traded.</p>", "creation_date": "2011-02-21 12:54:28", "thumbnail": "/media/upload/images/articles/20112211372333340.jpg"}}, {"pk": 73, "model": "main.Article", "fields": {"category": 4, "title": "Joyou Opens First Brand Experience Centre", "summary": "", "content": "<p>Hamburg, 9 March 2011.
